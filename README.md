# Hand Gesture Control Project using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI

## Introduction
This project utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to enable control of the device's mouse, a car racing game, and media player functions through hand gestures. It integrates these functionalities into a web application using Flask, showcasing real-time interaction with hand movements captured via a webcam.

## Features
- Control the device's mouse cursor using hand gestures.
- Play a car racing game by steering with hand movements.
- Manage media player functions such as play, pause, skip, and volume adjustment using specific hand gestures.

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV: Computer vision library for real-time image processing.
- MediaPipe: Google's framework for building machine learning pipelines to process perceptual data, used here for hand tracking.
- PyAutoGUI: Python library for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.
- Flask: Python web framework used to integrate Python scripts into a web application.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- NumPy
